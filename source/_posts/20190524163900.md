The base component is a **ScrollView** from the react-native package. It is a content container which wraps the child views. The container's style uses a background color defined in UI library. 

```
import {BorderRadiuses, View, Text, Typography, Colors} from 'react-native-ui-lib'

<ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.container}>

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: Colors.dark80,
  },
```

The header is a UI text component with the modifiers **text30 dark10 marginB-20**. The modifiers helps to create a styled component easily and quickly. Modifiers are processed and converted to styles by **src\commons\modifiers.js**.

By using lodash.map on the BorderRadiues object, it extracts the pre-defined styles, such as: **br0, br10, br20** and builds an example for each.

The example view is placed in the center of the parent view and the label view is placed in the upper left corner by the following styles : 

```
  labelContainer: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 5,
    left: 5,
  },
```
