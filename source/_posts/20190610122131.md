My MacBook Pro bought in 2012 runs still well under OS X Mountain Lion, but many applications such as Firefox, Homebrew, stopped the support of that version of OS X and my MBP is a little bit too laggy to afford the OS upgrade. I spent a Friday evening to install a linux on that old MBP and the result is surprisingly good.

Ubuntu desktop linux has the best driver support to the mac hardware, and it is the distribution I chosen for the MBP. 

To create a bootable USB drive on, I downloaded **etcher** from https://www.balena.io/etcher/. Once installed, start the program and load the ubuntu 19.04 ISO image and then click FLash! button. A few minutes later, the USB drive is ready.

Reboot the macbook with "Option" kewy pressed, choose the USB drive created previously from the list and wait the ubuntu to boot. Ubuntu provides a way to run it in a live mode without installing it on the hard drive, I used the live mode for the first run to make sure the hardware's compatibilities.

- Graphic card correctly detected, the screen resolution is set without issue.
- Touchpad is detected and driver installed.
- Sound card is detected and driver installed.
- The keyboard needs to be set manually to Apple Keyboard, and then all the function keys work like a charm (volume, brightness, backlight). 
- Cable network works out of box, but WIFI driver needs to be enabled manually. 
- Suspend mode when the lid is closed.
- Apple+L key locks the screen.

The hard drive needs to be partitioned before installing linux, I used the GParted in live mode to remove the original mac partition and created the new linux partition.

Some chars like bar, brackets which are type with the modifier SHIFT + Option key combination can only be input with SHIFT + Right Option, the SHIFT + Left Option has no effect any more.
