Both VSCode and NodeJs can be installed in portable mode, they can be installed onto a USB drive or onto a PC without having the administrator right. 

### VSCode

Download the zip version, and create a **data** sub-folder under the unzipped folder. 

### NodeJs

Download the zip version and create etc/npmrc with the following contents : 

    cache = ${NODE_ENV}\.npm 
    tmp = ${NODE_ENV}\tmp 
    prefix = ${NODE_ENV} 
    userconfig = ${NODE_ENV}\.npmrc 
    init-module = ${NODE_ENV}\.npm-init.js 
    proxy =  
    https-proxy =  

**NODE_ENV** is an environment variable which points the node installation folder.
