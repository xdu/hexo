First component is the Toast from UIlib, his visibility is controlled by the state.showToast which is by default set to false. 

The screen then creates for every color defined in UIlib a tiny circle view (5x5 pixels), the view is filled with corresponding color. The view encapsulating the circle views has the following styles :
	
	flexDirection: 'row',
	flexWrap: 'wrap',
	
After that the screen group up the colors based on theirs names and builds for each group a horizontal scroll view. The horizontal scroll bar is hidden by using 

	showHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
	
In style sheet section it shows the modifier can not only be used as an component attribute, also inside style creation.

	colorBlockLabel : {
		...Typography.text90
	}
	
The width or height of a component can be specified relative to the window size, see below :
	
	const {width} = Dimensions.get('window');
	colorBlock: {
		width: width * 0.35,
		height: width * 0.25
	}
